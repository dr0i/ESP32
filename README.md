# ESP32: how to

This is a repo explaining how to program the ESP32 and use some sensors like
e.g. the CO2-sensor MH-Z14A.

I am an absolute beginner when it comes to C++ or microcontroller or sensors.
I am a pro in doing things wrong at first - and by writing it down to
avoid that hopefully in the future.

So here is some of the wrongs I stumbled into:

## Connect ESP32 with cable to PC
Find the proper cable (on \*nix ):

```basic
10 $ ls /dev/tty* > unconnected.log; 
20 connect with a new cable
30 $ ls /dev/tty* > connected.log ; 
40 $ diff unconnected.log connected.log
50 if no tty shows up in the diff, goto 20
```

I had to try *6* cables before '/dev/ttyUSB' did show up - what a relieve, ESP32
is not broken!

## Arduino IDE
Download the arduino ide from their homepage (not via your OS packet
manager - it may be way outdated!). 

Install esptools: https://github.com/espressif/esptool/

(on linux: `$ pip3 install esptool`. 
There is also a Debian/Ubuntu package python3-serial that can be installed first (`apt install python3-serial`).

Bring the ESP32 board to recognition by arduino ide:
Follow "Installation instructions using Arduino IDE Boards Manager" at
https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md:

Add the ESP32 board: `File->Preferences->additional_boards_manager_urls: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`

Then Tools->Board_menu and install esp32 platform (and don't forget to select
your ESP32 board from Tools->Board_menu after installation).

If you got `EMRDY:1` when in arduino ide`->tools->serial_monitor` you are not
connected. Wrong serial port or wrong cable or what.

If you upload a sketch and only get characters trash like:

)%Mâ¸®

every second or so, press the small "en" button on your ESP32. This enables it.

If serial monitor keeps being empty: change the baud rate of the monitor (right bottom selector)
to the value you use in the uploaded program (look at ```Serial.begin($value);``` ).

## Use some sensors

### DHT22 humidity and temperature
See https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-dht11-dht22-temperature-humidity-sensor-arduino-ide/

Read the DHT22 humidity and temperature sensor following. Worked instantly :)

### MH-Z14A CO2-Sensor
See https://github.com/rafalmag/ESP32-MH-Z14A

Read the MH-Z14A CO2-Sensor. That was hard - I got some plausible,
but very round measure (either 410 ppm or 430 ppm) around 12 times (~1 minute)
(this is normal, so wait a bit till the sensor sends correct data) after which I got
permanently 5000 ppm and sometimes -1 . 5000 ppm happens to be the  maximum of the sensors
measuring capacity. That's also the value written to output after the sensor is
booted. 

So ... problem was that I connected
the ESP32 eve 3.3V connector to power the MH-Z14A like proposed in "DHT22" (where
this was sufficient to use the DHT22) via the breadboard as shown in the link
above. After reading
https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1785 I understood
that the problem was too low voltage. Here 
https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=11904 is shown how to get the 5V (it's
the red VIN connector). Now the sensor measures nice, unround values :)

I did my best to simplify the program (it consists of one file and doesn't need
any library besides the standard Arduino) and wrote all kinds of notes and
sources of problems into it:
